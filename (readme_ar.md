# Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic data analysis using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

We analyze a sales dataset, calculate total and average sales, find maximum and minimum sales, explore specific data, and visualize sales per product.

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib.pyplot**: For plotting graphs.

## Dataset
- The dataset is an Excel file (`sales_large.xlsx`) that contains sales data.
- Columns include: `Product`, `Sales`, and other related columns.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install required libraries if not already installed:
   ```bash

3.Place the Excel file in the correct path or update the path in the code.

4.Run the Python script:
python sales_analysis.py
